    <p>Rack of Lamb Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
    <p><li><p><strong>Bread crumbs</strong>: Use store-bought or make your own bread crumbs.</p> </li>
        <li><p><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This rack of lamb is seasoned with garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper.</p></li> 
        <li><p><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Olive oil locks in moisture, preventing the meat from drying out.</p> </li>
        <li><p><strong>Lamb</strong>: If you can, have your butcher trim and french (remove excess meat, fat and cartilage) the rack of lamb so you don’t have to do it at home.</p> </li>
        <li><p><strong>Mustard</strong>: Dijon mustard gives the seasoned bread crumbs something to stick to. Plus, it adds irresistible flavor.</p> </li>
        </p>
        </ul>

        <p><h1>Ingredients</h1></p>    
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>

<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

<li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>

<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

<li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>

<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

<li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>

<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h1>Directions</h1></p>
        <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position.</li></p>

<p><li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</li></p>

<p><li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li></p>

<p><li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</li></p>
